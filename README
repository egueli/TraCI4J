- INSTALLATION

1- With Eclipse, import this package as a project in your workspace.

- USAGE

Make your project depend on TraCI4J. In your code, declare a variable of the
SumoTraciConnection type. This is the main class that runs a SUMO instance,
establishes a connection with it and provides methods/objects to issue commands
and retrieve information.

Some basic usage examples can be found in the "examples" directory.

The JUnit tests in the test/ directory can also be a good source of example code.
